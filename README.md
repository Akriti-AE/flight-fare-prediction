# Accurate Flight Fare Prediction Using Categorical Encoding and Random Forest
In this project, I developed a flight fare prediction model aimed at accurately estimating ticket prices using a comprehensive dataset of 0.1 million flights. The project began with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I utilized pandas and seaborn to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. To effectively handle categorical variables, I applied both One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding, ensuring that the data was properly formatted for model training. I then implemented a Random Forest model, known for its robustness in handling large datasets and its ability to capture complex interactions. Through careful hyperparameter tuning, I significantly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE), leading to a highly accurate prediction model capable of estimating flight fares with precision.
